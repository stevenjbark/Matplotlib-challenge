Observations from Data for Drug Treatment Regimens

1. Tumor Size Vs. Drug: Obvious advantages for capomulin and ramicane for tumor size reduction.
However, the clustering of all other drugs is suspicious. Usually there will be a distribution
of data across different levels of efficacy. Here there are two good and all others are bad.

2. Metastatic Progression Vs. Drug: This is a distribution more representative of a drug response
curve/chart. The variance is high with some of these drugs, but again capomulin and ramicane blocked
metastasis more effectively than other drugs. However, over the course of treatment, all of these 
drugs exhibited significant potential for at least one metastatic site.

3. Survival Curve Analysis: As expected, the best drugs for reduction of tumor size progression
and inhibition of metastasis exhibited the best overall effectiveness in survival (80% with ramicane
and 83% with capomulin). All other drugs tested were inferior, but this is not surprising given the
poor efficacy in controlling tumor progression and metastatic potential.

4. Percent Change Bar Graph: Alternative view on tumor reduction. Ramicane and capomulin are the
only drugs that effectively control tumor and metastatic progression. The correlation is obvious for
the survival curve and the bar graph confirms tumor reduction as a percentage reduction for these drugs.
Performance for all other drugs was poor.
